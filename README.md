# Miva Token Project
This is a solidity project to create a token called Miva Coin

# Description
This simple contract is created to perform the basic minting and burning operations.

# Getting Started

# Executing This Program
To compile the code, click the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.18" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile HelloWorld.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "MYTOKEN" contract from the dropdown menu, then click the "Deploy" button.

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it by calling the Mint, Burn and Balance functions. 

# Burning
Click on the "Burning" contract in the left-hand sidebar, enter the "address" and "value" and then click on the "Mint" function to burn tokens from the total token supply. Finally, click on the "transact" button to execute the function.

# Minting
Enter the "address" and "value" on the left-hand sidebar of the IDE and then click on the "Mint" function to mint new tokens added to the total token supply. Finally, click on the "transact" button to execute the function.

# Balance
Enter the "address" on the left-hand sidebar of the IDE, and then click on the "Balance" function to see the balance.
